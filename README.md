# Proc Parser and Natural Smantics

A Parser and Natural Semantics for the basic imperitive programming language, `Proc`.
Proc is a basic imperative programming that is proposed and defined in "Semantics with Applications, by H.R. Nielson and F. Nielson".
This project will take you through building a parser using MegaParsec, and later into defineing both dynamic and mixed natural semantics for the Proc language.
